*Maiden Flight* | 6/21/17
=====

Location: Parcel B Landing Strip

Condition: Warm, Very Windy

Duration: 2 mins

Flown: Manual

Mission: N/A

Notes:

First flight went well! Hand launch takeoff followed by two laps around the field. The plane was being blown all over the place, but that's 
to be expected from such a light craft. This was the first time flying at this field- I discovered that the trees behind the strip are 
very ominous, especially with a north easternly wind blowing right into them. I'll have to look into it more but I'd be interested in having
the landing strip elsewhere.

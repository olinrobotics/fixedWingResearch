*9x6 Prop modification*  | 7/3/17
======

Details:
  After the maiden flight, I was hoping for more power with the custom power system. SA^3 was here and I was thinking that they would want another test flight so I dove into modifying the Bixler to fit a larger prop. eCalc suggested a 9x6E, giving me a 100% increase in stall thrust and a 150% increase in static thrust. However, an increase in the prop size meant the prop would hit the tail section. I didn't want to increase the height of the motor more, as the pitching moment was right where I liked it, so I decided to make more room by cutting into the tail.

  Unfortunatly, I found after cutting into the tail that the tail was hollow. This meant that I needed to stiffen up the cut section for reassembly, so I decided to embed 3 carbon fiber rods into the tail. I cut the slot for prop clearance, made holes for the rods and glued it all back together with UHU-POR.

  The Bixler should be all set to fly now, with a nearly 1:1 thrust ratio on a 3300mah 3s LiPo. 






*Maiden Flight* | 6/21/17
=====

Location: Parcel B Landing Strip

Condition: Warm, Very Windy

Duration: 2 mins

Flown: Manual

Mission: N/A

Notes:

First flight went well! Hand launch takeoff followed by two laps around the field. The plane was being blown all over the place, but that's 
to be expected from such a light craft. This was the first time flying at this field- I discovered that the trees behind the strip are 
very ominous, especially with a north easternly wind blowing right into them. I'll have to look into it more but I'd be interested in having
the landing strip elsewhere.

*Power System Upgrade*  | 6/19/17
======

Details:

I flew the Bixler once previously and got hit with a wicked down draft. Even flying nose up full throttle I was blown down into the trees- after this, I decided that I needed to upgrade the power system.

I searched through Professor Bennet's motor supply until I found a burshless motor close enough to what I needed- an 920kv RCTimer motor, initially intended for a multirotor. I paired it with a 8x6 prop and a 30amp esc. 

Finally, I cut out the original motor pod and laser cut a mount out of two 1/4in pieces of plywood.
